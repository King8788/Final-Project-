		<p> Our founder started out like just like anyone else looking for a home. She stated working with a retail agency to fine a home. But to much of her dismay there were not attentive to her requests. They were more focused on showing her overpriced houses and none really took the time out to search for what she wanted in a place she will call home. She eventually found her home on her own with out the help of the agency she hired. It was at this moment she realzied she didn't want anyone else to go through what she when through. She wanted to provide people not just with a businness transaction for a house but with a memorable experience in purchasing a home. And so KS properties was born.  KS Properties started out based on an idea. An idea that we wouldn't just push to sell you a house. But we would take the time to find that perfect place that you and your loved ones can call home.   </p>
