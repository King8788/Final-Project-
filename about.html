		<p> Our founder started out like just like anyone else looking for a home. She stated working with a retail agency to find one. But to much of her dismay there were not attentive to her and never showed her a place that she could call home. It was at this moment she realzied she didn't want anyone else to go through what she when through. She wanted to provide people not just with a businness transaction for a house but with a memorable experience in purchasing a home.  KS Properties started out based on an idea. An idea that we wouldn't just push to sell you a house. But we would take the time to find that perfect place that you and your loved ones can call home.   </p>
